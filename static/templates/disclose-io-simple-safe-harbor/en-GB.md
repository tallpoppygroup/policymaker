# Simple Safe Harbour

We will consider your security research to be authorised if you make a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your security research. If your activities violate certain restrictions in our Acceptable Use Policy, we will waive those restrictions for the limited purpose of allowing security research. We will not initiate legal proceedings against you for attempting to circumvent the technological safeguards we have put in place to protect the applications in scope. If a third party takes legal action against you for activities carried out in accordance with this policy, we will make this authorisation known.

For inadvertent, good-faith violations of this policy, we will not take legal action or report to law enforcement. Before undertaking any actions that may conflict with or go beyond the scope of this policy, please contact us by submitting a report.
